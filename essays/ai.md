# Reflect on Your Use of AI in ICS 314

## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in education, offering opportunities to enhance learning experiences and optimize workflows. In the context of Software Engineering, AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and GitHub Copilot provide support for coding, debugging, and concept exploration. In ICS 314, I have utilized AI to assist with tasks such as writing essays, debugging code, and understanding software engineering principles. Ironically, I am using AI to write this very essay—in fact, the entire essay was written with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT. This feels like poetic justice given the excessive writing assignments in a non-writing intensive course. The lack of grading resources for a writing credit only adds to the frustration. As a former translator, this feels like a waste of time, but I find it beautifully ironic to leverage AI for an assignment critiquing its use.


## II. Personal Experience with AI

### Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

For the Functional Programming WOD E18, I asked ChatGPT, “How can I implement \_.pluck in JavaScript for a functional programming task?” While the response provided a starting point, it required additional adjustments to align with the specific requirements of the assignment. Using AI saved time, but the trial-and-error process to refine the solution underscored its limitations.

### In-class Practice WODs

During practice WODs, I used ChatGPT to explain syntax or troubleshoot errors. For example, I asked, “What does this ESLint error mean in JavaScript?” The responses were helpful in identifying and fixing issues but occasionally lacked context, requiring me to cross-check with documentation.

### In-class WODs

For live WODs, I refrained from using AI directly to simulate real-world, time-constrained problem-solving scenarios. I felt that relying on AI might detract from developing my own problem-solving skills.

### Essays

Writing essays has been the most notable use case for AI, as every section of this essay was generated using ChatGPT. This reliance stems from the sheer volume of writing assignments in this computer science course, which feels excessive, especially given that it doesn’t count as writing intensive. While essays may encourage reflection, their sheer quantity detracts from focusing on core programming skills. For instance, I used ChatGPT to draft reflections by prompting it with, “Write an essay analyzing the use of AI in education, specifically in software engineering.” This saved time but occasionally produced generic or verbose content requiring manual editing.

### Final Project

For the final project, AI was instrumental in generating boilerplate code. Prompts like “Generate a Next.js layout component” provided immediate results that I modified to fit the project’s needs. While useful, I avoided relying on AI for logic-heavy tasks to maintain originality.

### Learning a Concept / Tutorial

When learning concepts like functional programming or state management, I asked ChatGPT to simplify explanations. A specific example: “Explain Redux state management in simple terms.” The AI’s responses were clear and concise, enhancing my understanding.

### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord

On Discord, I occasionally used AI to preformulate questions. For example: “What’s the best way to ask for help with JavaScript async errors?” This ensured my questions were precise and actionable.

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question

When asked about database optimizations, I queried ChatGPT: “Explain indexing in Postgres and its benefits.” This helped me craft an informed response.

### Coding Example

For a coding example on “Underscore \_.pluck”, I used AI to draft a function: “Write a function using \_.pluck to extract values from an array of objects.” The output needed minor tweaks, highlighting the value of AI as a starting tool rather than a complete solution.

### Explaining Code

AI was helpful for generating code comments. Prompts like “Explain this JavaScript function:” produced useful documentation, improving code readability.

### Writing Code

For boilerplate tasks, I used prompts such as “Generate a function for input validation in JavaScript.” The generated code saved time but required scrutiny to ensure it adhered to project requirements.

### Documenting Code

I used ChatGPT to write JSDoc comments by asking, “Generate JSDoc for this function:” This streamlined the documentation process but occasionally missed nuances in the code logic.

### Quality Assurance

For debugging, I used prompts like “Fix the following ESLint errors:” The suggestions were often accurate but sometimes overgeneralized, requiring manual intervention.

### Other Uses in ICS 314

AI proved invaluable for brainstorming ideas, generating test cases, and simplifying complex concepts. For example, “Generate test cases for a login function” provided a baseline to build upon.


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has significantly influenced my learning, offering a safety net for exploring unfamiliar concepts and accelerating routine tasks. This essay itself is a testament to AI’s capabilities, as every paragraph was drafted with ChatGPT’s assistance. My experience as a translator has shaped my expectations for AI, as I value tools that can streamline repetitive work while still requiring human refinement to ensure accuracy and nuance. This dual role of AI as both assistant and collaborator has been particularly evident in my approach to software engineering tasks. However, overreliance can hinder deeper understanding. For example, while AI clarified syntax errors, it occasionally bypassed the need to explore foundational principles, challenging my grasp of core concepts.


## IV. Practical Applications

Beyond ICS 314, I used AI for HACC projects to generate API documentation and debug server issues. A notable prompt was “Explain CORS errors and how to fix them in a Next.js app.” This practical application reinforced the utility of AI in real-world scenarios.


## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The primary challenge was the occasional overgeneralization of AI responses, requiring additional validation. However, AI’s ability to simplify complex topics presents opportunities for broader adoption in education, such as interactive learning modules and personalized tutoring systems.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional methods foster deeper engagement and critical thinking, while AI enhances efficiency and provides alternative perspectives. AI’s immediacy complements traditional methods, striking a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application.


## VII. Future Considerations

AI’s role in software engineering education will likely expand, integrating tools like Copilot directly into learning environments. This integration could reduce the need for repetitive tasks, such as extensive writing assignments, allowing students to focus more on building technical skills and solving complex problems. Future advancements could include adaptive learning platforms that tailor content to individual progress, though challenges around accuracy and ethical use remain.


## VIII. Conclusion

Reflecting on my use of AI in ICS 314 reveals a nuanced relationship: AI is a powerful tool for enhancing efficiency and exploring new concepts, yet it requires careful application to avoid dependence. To optimize AI integration in future courses, educators should focus on combining AI-driven tools with traditional learning methods to foster both innovation and foundational understanding.
