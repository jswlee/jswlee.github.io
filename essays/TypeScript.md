### Free 7-Day Trial
	A full week has passed in ICS 314. We have been learning about JavaScript and its bigger brother, TypeScript. As a complete newcomer to anything outside of Java and Python (having started in the ICS program Spring 2024), I have found TypeScript not to be particularly challenging to pick up. From what I can tell so far, TypeScript pairs the simplicity of a language like Python and the strict data typing of Java. Also, as someone with some experience working with datasets thanks to an internship, I can imagine being able to define the data types of elements/variables provides much of the same functionality as creating a dataset in SQL. Thus, having had exposure to the necessity of this data typing in Java (where everything needs a type) and SQL (where types must be predefined for data integrity), this aspect of TypeScript was easy to comprehend.

### TypeScript: Javathon? Pythava? 
	On the other hand, I have noticed an interesting “eccentricity” to JavaScript and, by extension, TypeScript. From what I can tell, the concept of an object in JavaScript is not entirely the same as Java. Indeed, it was a bit strange to me to define an object using syntax that appeared at first glance to be a variable or function. As someone who has taken both ICS 111 and ICS 211 (both of which teach concepts using Java) within the past half year, this caught me by surprise, since Java is oriented so heavily towards classes and instantiating those classes into objects. As a novice, I also feel like the syntax introduced in ES6 looks like Python. For example, the for-each / for-in syntax in ES6 is similar to how it would be implemented in Python. Given how little time we have actually spent building anything in TypeScripts, I think it would be premature for me to make any comments on TypeScript’s usefulness with respect to software engineering, given that I have little to no experience with software engineering.

### WOD Like More
	As for the Workouts of the Day (WOD) where we learned how to use the TypeScript Playground, I noticed in the beginning that I struggled a little bit with the syntax. Since we had only had a little bit of practice thanks to FreeCodeCamp, this wasn’t altogether surprising. However, I was able to complete the first WOD (Project Euler #1) well within the time limit. The second one I failed the first go around, because I was dead set on solving it a certain way, and got bogged down in trying to make that work before switching tactics last minute and going over the time limit. However, after I looked up how to create a set in JavaScript (I was used to importing it in Java), I solved it within 3 minutes. I found the WODs only mildly stressful and mostly fun, since I enjoy working on problems, making mistakes, and learning from them. My overall impression of TypeScript Playground and the WODs is that the concept is good, but I would prefer if we had considerably more practice. I do, however, feel like this is something I like to practice, which will make all the difference for my learning in the long run.
