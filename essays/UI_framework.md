### Another Day, Another Essay

It's that wonderful time of the semester where we have been tasked with the joyous venture of practicing how to string words together into sentences that form a coherent essay. Well, perhaps coherent AND following certain guidelines to avoid having points ingloriously knocked off our final grade. To say I have strong feelings against this particular aspect of the Software Engineering class is an understatement. Why do we have to write so much, you ask? "Mayhaps 'tis thusly in order to fulfill some Writing Intensive requirement, my good sir?", you might say. I can confidently assure you, young padawan, that is moist certainly not the case, as this class lacks the necessary grading resources. (Did you catch that juicy misspelling?)

As someone with a background writing for a living (sure, translation isn't really creative writing, though, is it?), I could easily chuck this essay prompt straight into the magic portal of ChatGPT, whereupon some unlucky AI goblin minion would churn the most fascinating, in-depth commentary on UI frameworks, but what's the fun in that? Sure, I see the irony of someone absolutely loathing these assignments actually spending the time to do them when our machine underlings are so competent.

But I digress. On to my engaging, informative exploration of UI frameworks.

Okay, I lied. Here are a few sentences from a guy who has spent a literal week on this topic and knows about as much about it as a toddler knows about cleaning up after herself (if it sounds like I am speaking from personal experience, you could be right):

1. UI Frameworks are a thing.
2. Bootstrap 5 is a UI framework.
3. Bootstrap 5 makes containerizing page elements fast and easy.
4. I still can't figure this shit out.
5. I will learn more as I practice.
6. The end.

Oh, and for funsies, here's an example of how bad I am at this despite spending forever trying to figure it out (hint: I am the first one).
