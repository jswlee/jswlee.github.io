As part of my internship at the City and County of Honolulu's Office of Economic Revitalization, I was tasked with identifying areas in Oahu where there exists economic, linguistic, and educational inequities that might inhibit the economic mobility of those living there. 

Thanks to the vague nature of my assignment and my own "greenness", the journey to get to a workable analysis was not straightforward. I first began with researching previous studies and data, but realized later with a meeting with my superiors that they lacked granularity -- specifically with regards to the Asian and Pacific Islander population on the island. This led me to attempt to replicate the analyses of these studies by going straight to the data sources. It was then that I discovered the US Census Bureau provided annual data samples of the American Community Survey. While I later learned how to extract the sample (Public Use Microdata Sample, PUMS) from the Census Bureau's API, at the time, the best I knew how to do was extract the data from IPUMS, who provide a simple interface to select samples and variable for extraction.

After several more meetings with the uppers, I narrowed down the variables of interest, learning that another area of interest was new immigrants. The work culiminated in several Tableau dashboards and a report that I presented in person to Councilmember Matt Weter at his office.
