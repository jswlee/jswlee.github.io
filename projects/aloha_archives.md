### Barely Hacking It
Shortly after the kickoff of the 2024 Hawai'i Annual Code Challenge, I formed a team from my Intro to Software Engineering class to see if we could tackle one of the open challenges. Due to our own "greenness", I picked what I had hoped would be one of the simpler challenges of creating a web portal to replace the State of Hawai'i's own open data portal. Despite having a month to complete the project, we did not produce what I would consider to be something that had any potential to win any awards. Even still, it was a valuable experience where I learned how to manage a project and team all while cramming as much future class content as possible to make up for our lack of experience.

For the first two weeks of the challenge, we did our best to square away some of the bigger picture details: what do we want the portal's main functions to be, who is going to do what (and when), and how do we even work collectively on a programming project when none of us had ever used GitHub collaboratively. I took my role as seriously as I could given my work load and secret identity as a stay-at-home dad. I was in charge of making sure (to the best of my ability) that we were moving forward each week by assigning tasks, talking through each person's time commitment expectations, and managing morale when we felt like we were getting nowhere.

In the end, after several long nights by me frantically trying to check all the boxes to ensure we at least submitted something, we had successfully moved on to the next stage of presenting. Knowing I had gotten us all into this mess and the timing couldn't have been any worse with midterms, I spent several days working on how to distill out project into a 2-minute presentation (and memorize my pitch). It wasn't easy and, I won't lie, it wasn't fun. But I don't regret trying. The end product wasn't ideal, but I felt an odd sense of pride in our team that, despite not only learning our tech stack on-the-spot, but also figuring out just what software engineering even is, we made something functional. More so than that, though, was that we had the courage to present knowing full-well that everyone in the room was more accomplished software engineers than us.
